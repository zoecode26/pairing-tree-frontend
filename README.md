The frontend of PairTree, click <a href="https://github.com/zoecode26/pairing-tree-backend">here</a> to see the backend repo.

PairTree is a web application that allows developers to connect and learn together by pair programming and sharing knowledge. 

Users can:
- Create an account and add their language preferences and skill levels
- Get matched with other developers who work with the same technologies
- Use the in-app messaging feature to arrange times to pair program!

### Technologies
- React frontend
- Springboot backend
- PostgreSQL database

####NOTE: This project was created as a team as part of the Makers Academy Bootcamp. I have since refactored parts of the code and hosted the web application.
